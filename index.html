<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls a single piece of coal that can only jump around the environment. The player is constantly followed by a tiny flame that will hurt them if they touch it, but can be used to solve environmental puzzles. Puzzles involve lighting lamps or candles with the fire to open doors or new parts of the environment. Candles don't stay lit forever, and some lamps require a specific order to be lit in. The player must learn to fling the tiny flame in order for it to reach places the player couldn't reach. The flame ignores all obsticals except water. Water can cool off the player to keep them from dying in more difficult portions of the game, but can also douse the fire requiring the player to return to the source of the fire to regain the tiny flame that must be used to advance. The fire can be used to propel the player to higher ledges hurting the player in the process. After each contact with the flame, the coal gets a little redder each time, after the third hit, they die and must start over from the beginning. Throughout the game the moon slowly wanes in the sky until the world is pitch black, resulting in more difficult settings where the tiny flame and the torhes lit on the way are the only source of light.
